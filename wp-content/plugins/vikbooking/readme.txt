Famous Booking Engine, PMS and Hotel Reservations plugin for single properties. The best solution for accommodations to drive more direct bookings.

== Description ==

= Vik Booking for WordPress =

The famous Booking Engine and PMS online software for accommodations is now available also for WordPress as a native Plugin!

If you are looking for a reliable reservation system for a Hotel, B&B, Villa, Apartments, Hostel or any similar accommodation, then you have found the right plugin. In fact, Vik Booking is a **PCI-DSS** and **OpenTravel** compliant hotel Booking Engine used by thousands of properties every day.

This is the **free** version of the plugin, but you can upgrade to the **Pro** version at any time from your *wp-admin* section. Experience the power of a true and internal Booking Engine that competes with the best ones of the world!

The **Pro** version is compatible with *Vik Channel Manager*, the first and only native Channel Manager for WordPress, listed as a Premier Partner of **Booking.com** since 2018 among the top 20 systems worldwide. **Full API** connections available with the most famous OTAs such as **Airbnb**, **Expedia** and **Google Hotel** for their new Free Booking Links! Beware of "fake" Channel Manager plugins that only offer unreliable iCal synchronizations with no private access to the OTA's APIs.

Vik Booking was born in 2010 for a different web-software (CMS) than WordPress, and that's how it became famous. The same powerful framework is now (since 2018) at the service of all webmasters, designers and web-agencies that work with WordPress. It's definitely the hotel reservation plugin that you, or your client, were looking for.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is upgrading to Pro mandatory? =

No, not at all. However, it took our company 8 years to build the *Pro* version and we are willing to spend a lot more years of work on this software. We encourage you to evaluate the free version first, and then upgrade to Pro to unlock its potential.

= Why some functions are not available in the free version? =

We are a software development company listed as a certified Channel Manager Provider by the major OTAs of the world. We work to deliver a full software solution for CMS and Web Software like WordPress as a valid alternative to the same proprietary and external systems. We make money by selling licenses of the Pro version.

= Is it worth upgrading to Pro? =

Vik Booking is not a one-page plugin. You can build websites worth a lot of money with this plugin. You don't need anything else to deliver a complete website, if not a Theme and some experience with WordPress.

= Can I build a portal of multiple properties/apartments? =

No, you can't! Vik Booking was designed specifically for single properties, or multiple properties managed by the same company. Basically, you cannot build a portal with multiple vendors where certain users should access and manage only their rooms and reservations. Vik Booking is a true booking engine for Hotels, B&Bs, Apartments, Villas and Hostels. It should be installed on the website of the accommodation. Even though permissions for receptionists and managers can be set up, the logic of the software remains single-vendor.
If you are looking for a solution for a real-estate agency (for example) that manages multiple properties on its own, then it's still fine as long as you don't need specific users/owners to see or manage their own data because this is not supported.

= Can I use Vik Booking with my preferred Theme? =

Yes, of course. You are free to install Vik Booking on your website with your own Theme. The plugin will adjust to it thanks to its own CSS framework. It is also possible to work on a custom CSS file to adjust some layouts.

= What about Vik Channel Manager or E4JConnect? =

Vik Booking is the Booking Engine and PMS plugin, it can work alone on any existing website. However, if you are looking to establish real-time API connections with OTAs like Booking.com, Airbnb, Expedia, Google Hotel Ads etc.. then you need to use our full solution, which is composed of a one-time fee to purchase the Pro version of Vik Booking as well as the plugin Vik Channel Manager. The only recurring cost, just like any existing (and real) Channel Manager software, is the one to keep the connection active with the various channels. This is the subscription for our certified and award-winning Channel Manager service called "e4jConnect". Please notice that all these services are entirely provided by our company, it's one single company with no third party connections. We are the software developer company as well as the Channel Manager provider. This makes a big difference.
